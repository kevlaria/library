library
=======

In this assignment you will implement software for your local library. The user of the software will be the librarian, who uses your program to issue library cards, check books out to patrons, check books back in, send out overdue notices, and open and close the library.

Library rules:

You must have a library card in order to check out books.
You can have at most 3 books checked out at a time.
Books are due one week (7 days) after being checked out--no renewals.
You will receive an overdue notice (just one) when a book becomes overdue.
The notice will list all the books you have checked out, and will indicate which ones are overdue.
